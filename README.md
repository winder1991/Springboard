# This repository stores my course work related to Data Science and Machine Learning.
Majority of work is related to machine learning projects done in UCSD Machine Learnig Bootcamp (in progress).
The following is a summary of current projects here:

--DataVisualizationFinalProject-1：
A Data Visualization project done during data science cource for data science certificate. It uses python to analyze the data from yahoo finance on four industries and try to check if they are influenced by US-China trade war. It saves the data in MySQL and display the results in Tableau Dashboard.

--mec-3.4.1-api-mini-project：
In this mini-project, I use API requests to grab data from NASDAQ and analyze data based on requirements using Jupyter Notebook.

--iris
A practice for plotting using matplotlib, also tried to show legends without using seaborn

--mec-5.3.10-data-wranging-with-pandas-mini-project：
A practice for data wrangling using pandas and plot charts

--mec-5.4.4-json-data-wrangling-mini-project：
A practice for data wrangling import json and use json_normalize to unwind nested structure of json file

--mec-5.5.4-webscraping-project：
A practice based on tutorial <https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html>. The following is done:
   1) a class based on scrapy css method
   2) a class based on scrapy xpath method
   3) a python file which writes the json file to sqlite

--mec-5.6.6-sql-with-spark-mini-project：
This project is using spark sql in Databricks.

It investigate the boston dataset and evaluate the model in the following parameters:
    - outlier and leverage
    - R-squared value
    - F-statistic
    - F-test

--mec-12.4.2-logistic-regression-mini-project
This is an exercise on classification using logistic regression method.
